## Components

### SDIA-Orchestrator 
Summary: Orchestrates the execution of TOSCA workflows. Generates declarative workflows which are automatically generated by the orchestrator based on nodes, relationships, and groups defined in the topology. Orchestrates the execution of imperative workflows which are manually specified.  

### Infrastructure Planner 
Summary: Generates valid infrastructure TOSCA description that can create a declarative workflow 
Input TOSCA Template with software components, policies and  partial or no infrastructure
Output  TOSCA Template with software components, policies and infrastructure


### Infrastructure Provisioner
Summary: Cloud infrastructure API integrator. 
Input: TOSCA provision workflow
Output: TOSCA Template with node states (running, stopped, deleted,error, etc)

### Deployer 
Summary: Deploys software on infrastructure   
Input: TOSCA provision workflow
Output: TOSCA Template with node states (running, stopped, deleted,error, etc)

### Tosca Parser
Summary: Can query TOSCA templates to get nodes, node names, etc.
REST API: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/skoulouzis/tosca-sure/1.0.1


## External Components    

### TOSCA storage (MongoDB https://www.mongodb.com/, GIT)
Summary: DB to store TOSCA template documents 

### Ansible Playbook executor (Semaphore https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore )
Summary: Executes ansible playbooks 
REST API: https://ansible-semaphore.github.io/semaphore/

### Playbook project storage (MySQL https://www.mysql.com/ )
Summary: Used by the ansible executor to store playbook projects 
Metrics DB (Prometheus https://prometheus.io/ ) 
Summary: Stores application and infrastructure metrics 


## Definitions and Schemas

### TOSCA Definitions
Summary: TOSCA types, nodes, interfaces etc. adapted for the SDIA framework 

### OpenAPI Models 
Summary: schemata shared with services
